  ! What is Javascript?

   - Javascript is :
   - 1.Single Threaded :
      - i.e  because it has only one call stack where the function
      is executed.
   - 2.Blocking By Default Non-Blocking : 
      - because the slow processes which require call to the Web API are
      executed in the Web API leaving the call stack open for other 
      function execution.
   - 3.Synchronous By Default,and Asynchronous Behaviour Provided
    by Web API.
   - 4.Concurrent .(at the same time; simultaneously.)
   - 5.Interpreted.
   - 6.Dynamically Type.
   

   - Programming language.
   - Further which Allows us to implement Complex features and provide
   interactivity to Web Page.

/*
  Compiled Language :
  The source code is passed through a program called a compiler,
  which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands 
  and can execute.

  5.Interpreted Language :
  directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting 
  language without previously converting them to an object code or
  machine code.

*/
/*
  6.Dynamically Type Language :
  Dynamically-typed language where the interpreter assigns variables 
  a type at runtime based on the variable's value at the time.
  
  7. Java Script is Case Sensitve Language.
  var myVariable = "Hello";
  var myvariable = "World";

/*
 Java Vs JS

-Java was developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s.
-JavaScript was created by Netscape in the same period, around 1995.

* Typing:
-Java is a statically-typed language, 
where variable types are declared before compilation.
-JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, 
allowing variables to dynamically change types during runtime.

* Object Models:
-Java follows a class-based object-oriented programming paradigm.
-JavaScript follows a prototype-based object-oriented programming paradigm.
 Objects can be created dynamically during runtime


* Execution Environment:
- Java applications run on the JVM, allowing them to platform-independent.

- JavaScript code is executed by web browsers, making it a client-side 
scripting language. With the introduction of Node.js,
JavaScript can also be used on the server side.
