// COMMUNICATING ON THE WEB

/*
   When two computers communicate with each other, they need to use the same rules.
   An English speaker can't communicate verbally with a Japanese speaker,
   similarly, two computers need to speak the same language to communicate.
  
   ?This "language" that computers use is called a protocol.
   
   The most popular protocol for web communication is HTTP, which stands for
   ?Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

// HTTP POWERS WEBSITES

/*

  As we discussed, HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a protocol designed 
  to transfer information between computers.
  
  There are other protocols for communicating over the internet, 
  but HTTP is the most popular and is particularly great for websites and 
  web applications. 
  
  Each time you visit a website, your browser is making an HTTP request to that 
  website's server.
  
  The server responds with all the text, images, and styling information that your
  browser needs to render its pretty website!
